Starting with the 1.4.0 release [1], we don't offer these modules anymore:

* pam_tally and pam_tally2 have been deprecated and replaced
  by the pam_faillock module
* pam_cracklib has been deprecated and replaced
  by the pam_passwdqc module

These changes affected our basic PAM stack configuration.

You only need to take action if:
* you made manual changes to the PAM stack, or
* you use FEATURES="-config-protect-if-modified" option

If this applies to you, please make sure to either run the etc-update or
dispatch-conf command in order to sync your configuration.

Failure to do this may result in your system becoming inaccessible.
