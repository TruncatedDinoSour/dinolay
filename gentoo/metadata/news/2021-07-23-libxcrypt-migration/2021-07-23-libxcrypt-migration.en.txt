The implementation of libcrypt.so within glibc has been deprecated
for a long time and will be removed in the near future.

For this reason, we are following other distributions (where
this has been tested for years already) and switching to the 
external libxcrypt implementation, starting with ~arch 
installations.

This will be a regular update, and in nearly all cases you
will not have to take any action and not observe any problems.

We do recommend, however, that your system is *fully* up
to date first. This is a standard recommendation but in this
specific case, it is useful to have a simplified depgraph
to ensure that Portage is able to smoothly calculate
an upgrade path.

That is, please take the opportunity to fully upgrade your
systems now, before the migration occurs, to simplify matters.

This change will occur on 2021-07-14 for ~arch users. Stable
users will update at a later date.

If for whatever reason you do *not* wish to switch now -
which is only delaying the inevitable - you
need to take the following steps:
* unmask and enable the crypt USE flag of sys-libs/glibc
* mask the system USE flag of sys-libs/libxcrypt
* mask >=virtual/libcrypt-2

If you wish to manually migrate now, there are a series
of steps described on the wiki (see below), but the outline is:
* unforce the crypt USE flag of sys-libs/glibc and disable it
* unmask the system and split-usr (if applicable) USE flag of sys-libs/libxcrypt
and enable it
* unmask ~virtual/libcrypt-2

Please note that if you last changed your password before ~2008,
it may be using md5crypt or similar other weak mechanisms in /etc/shadow;
a bug in PAM [0][1] may mean that you were unable to login. We recommend
using "passwd" to change/refresh your password so it is using modern
methods. A new version of PAM has been added to the tree to resolve this issue.

In some cases, Portage may schedule a rebuild of certain packages in an
incorrect order [2]. If building a package fails, please try upgrading
libcrypt and libxcrypt first:

# emerge -v1 virtual/libcrypt sys-libs/libxcrypt

And then continue the world upgrade with Portage's "--keep-going=y".
