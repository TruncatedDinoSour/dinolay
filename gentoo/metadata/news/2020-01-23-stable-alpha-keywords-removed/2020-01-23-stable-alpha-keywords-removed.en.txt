The Gentoo/Alpha team no longer thinks that the time invested in package
stabilization is warranted for the small number of users on Alpha. As a
result, we will drop all "alpha" keywords to "~alpha" on 2020-01-25 and will
add "~alpha" to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS in the profile.

Users need not make any changes to their systems, and the Gentoo/Alpha team
has no plans to remove support for the architecture.
