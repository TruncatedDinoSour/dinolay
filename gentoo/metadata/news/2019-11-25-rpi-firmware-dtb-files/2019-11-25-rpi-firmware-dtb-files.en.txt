sys-boot/raspberrypi-firmware up to and including version 1.20190709
installed files /boot/*.dtb and /boot/overlays/*. Newer versions will no
longer install these files.

These files will be installed by sys-kernel/raspberrypi-image package.

If you do not use sys-kernel/raspberrypi-image, you need to install
these files according to the method you use to install the kernel. For
installation from source, this can be done with such commands:

    make dtbs
    cp -v arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb /boot/
    cp -rv arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/ /boot/

This change is being made to enable arm64 users and custom kernels users
to use sys-boot/raspberrypi-firmware package.
