To reduce the burden on main Gentoo repository, older versions of Wine
will be available only in the wine overlay. These ebuilds will still be
fully supported by the Gentoo Wine Project.  This will result in
upstream stable releases and the several most recent upstream devel
releases being the only versions in ::gentoo; all versions meeting the
criteria for support within Gentoo [1] will be available in ::wine.

To install the overlay you can either add the repos.conf file to your
portage configuration directory, add the repository via layman, or add the
repository via eselect-repository.

* To add the repos.conf file:
# wget https://dev.gentoo.org/~np-hardass/proj/wine/wine.conf -O \
    /etc/portage/repos.conf/wine.conf

Edit the /etc/portage/repos.conf/wine.conf file so that "location"
points to your desired folder to install the overlay.
# emaint sync --repo wine

* To install the overlay via layman:
# layman -a wine

* To install the overlay via eselect-repository:
# eselect repository enable wine
