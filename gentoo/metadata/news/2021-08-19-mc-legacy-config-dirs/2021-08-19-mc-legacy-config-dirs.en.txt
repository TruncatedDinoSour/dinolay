app-misc/mc versions between 4.8.1 and 4.8.26, inclusive, would look
for their user configuration in two possible places:

 * if built with USE=-xdg, only the legacy directory ~/.mc is used;

 * if built with USE=xdg, mc uses appropriate XDG user directories
   (e.g. ~/.config/mc, ~/.local/share/mc) if present and attempts
   to automatically migrate the contents of ~/.mc otherwise.

However, starting with version 4.8.27 Midnight Commander will use _only
XDG user directories_ for its configuration and no longer automatically
migrate the contents of ~/.mc. For more information, see:

    https://midnight-commander.org/wiki/NEWS-4.8.27
    https://midnight-commander.org/ticket/3682

For everyone who currently uses app-misc/mc[-xdg], or has not started
mc for so long that it hasn't had a chance to migrate its configuration,
upgrading to 4.8.27 or newer will result in Midnight Commander
effectively reverting to default user configuration. In order to prevent
this from happening, make sure automatic migration is available:

    echo 'app-misc/mc xdg' >> /etc/portage/package.use
    emerge --oneshot <app-misc/mc-4.8.27

and have every user on your system with ~/.mc present run both 'mc'
and 'mcedit' at least once prior to the version upgrade.

No action is required of everyone currently using app-misc/mc
with USE=xdg enabled.
