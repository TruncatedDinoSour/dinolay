As the Games team does not have enough manpower to keep tabs on all
games packages, we have dropped all ebuilds maintained by the games
project to unstable KEYWORDS (without those required by other stable
packages). If you have any of these stable games packages installed,
you will have to add them to /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/
manually. Failures related to missing stable KEYWORDS will show up as

  The following keyword changes are necessary to proceed:
   (see "package.accept_keywords" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
  # required by @selected
  # required by @world (argument)
  =games-action/0verkill-0.16-r4 ~amd64

While we accept that this will cause some irritation for the community,
pretending we have a well supported games collection by having a
wealth of stable games packages is misleading at best. We welcome
contributions from outsiders willing to polish up the games landscape
in Gentoo via the Proxy Maintainers Project.
