OpenCL support in Gentoo is now being migrated to having all implementations
operate through an ICD loader (dev-libs/ocl-icd or dev-libs/opencl-icd-loader)
installed directly into /usr rather than using eselect-opencl to switch
between implementations, with updated loader ebuilds having just been released
to the public. Unfortunately although the upgrade process will automatically
uninstall app-eselect/eselect-opencl, it will not remove the symbolic links to
libOpenCL.so created by this tool in library directories because those links
are not owned by the package in question.

For everyone using the default Gentoo configuration of collision protection
(FEATURES='-collision-protect protect-owned'), this should cause no trouble
because this configuration allows the overwriting of orphaned files.
Obviously, systems with collision protection completely disabled (not
recommended but technically possible) will not be affected either. However,
if your system is configured for full collision protection
(FEATURES=collision-protect), it will be necessary to manually remove those
links

    rm -i /usr/lib{,64}/libOpenCL.so*

before running the upgrade.
