The Gentoo/HPPA team no longer thinks that the time invested in
package stabilization is warranted for the small number of users on
HPPA. As a result, we will drop most "hppa" keywords to "~hppa" on
2020-12-31. Around 850 packages will retain their stable keywords.

Users need not make any changes to their systemsâ€”other than perhaps
adding some entries to their package.accept_keywords file. The
Gentoo/HPPA team has no plans to remove support for the architecture.
