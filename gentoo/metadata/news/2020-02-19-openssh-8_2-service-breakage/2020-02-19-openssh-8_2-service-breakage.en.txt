If sshd is running, and a system is upgraded from
<net-misc/openssh-8.2_p1 to >=net-misc/openssh-8.2_p1, any new ssh
connection will fail until sshd is restarted.

Before restarting sshd, it is *strongly* recommended that you test your
configuration with the following command (as root):
    sshd -t

If your system is booted with openrc, use this command (as root) 
to restart sshd:
    rc-service sshd --nodeps restart

If your system is booted with systemd, use this command (as root)
to restart sshd:
    systemctl restart sshd

WARNING: On systemd booted machines with PAM disabled, this command
         will terminate all currently open ssh connections. It is 
         *strongly* recommended that you validate your configuration
         before restarting sshd.

If you are using systemd socket activation for sshd, then no action is
required.
