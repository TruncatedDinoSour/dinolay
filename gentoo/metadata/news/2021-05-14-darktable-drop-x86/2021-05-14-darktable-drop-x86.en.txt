Since version 3.0.0 media-gfx/darktable officially only supports 64-bit
architectures, and we have observed errors while attempting to build these
versions on x86 - making media-gfx/darktable-2.6.2 the last version to
support this architecture. However the 2.6.x branch of Darktable has not
seen any activity since October 2019 and we have just confirmed with upstream
that all but the latest release branch (3.4.x at the time of writing this) are
not supported.

In light of the above we have decided to remove media-gfx/darktable-2.6.2 from
the tree, thus dropping x86 support from that package, by 2021-06-15.
