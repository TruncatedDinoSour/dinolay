The Gentoo RISC-V team is discontinuing the riscv64 multilib stages and
profile. The main reason for this is that with the upcoming introduction
of riscv32 a multilib stage would contain both 32bit and 64bit binaries,
and so far no hardware exists that is able to run both and thus update
the stage or installation (unless you use qemu).

Please switch to the rv64gc/lp64d profile. This is done by
* selecting default/linux/riscv/17.0/rv64gc/lp64d with eselect profile
* rebuilding gcc
    emerge -1 sys-devel/gcc
* and then rebuilding your system
    emerge -ev @world

The default/linux/riscv/17.0/rv64gc profile will stop functioning soon.
