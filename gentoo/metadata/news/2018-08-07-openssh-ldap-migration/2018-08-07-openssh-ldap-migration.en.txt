If your sshd authenticates against LDAP, you have to migrate your
current setup to a new one using sshd's "AuthorizedKeysCommand" option and
a wrapper provided by packages like the new sys-auth/ssh-ldap-pubkey or
sys-auth/sakcl because beginning with net-misc/openssh-7.7_p1, OpenSSH-LPK
patch set is deprecated and no longer applies.

We have created a short migration guide in the Wiki [1] for more details.
