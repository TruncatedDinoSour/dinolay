The Gentoo/IA64 team no longer thinks that the time invested in package
stabilization is warranted for the small number of users on IA64. As a
result, we will drop all "ia64" keywords to "~ia64" on 2020-04-03 and will
add "~ia64" to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS in the profile.

Users need not make any changes to their systems, and the Gentoo/IA64 team
has no plans to remove support for the architecture.
